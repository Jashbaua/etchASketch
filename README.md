## Overview

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and Flexbox layout. When you hover over any square in the grid, it changes color, leaving a trail like a digital Etch-A-Sketch. You can reset the grid size at any time by clicking the “New Grid” button and entering a value between 1 and 100.

## Features

- **16×16 Default Grid**  
  On load, a 16×16 grid of square divs is generated by JavaScript and displayed using Flexbox.

- **Hover Drawing**  
  Moving your mouse over squares changes their background color, creating a “drawing” effect.

- **Dynamic Grid Resize**  
  Click the “New Grid” button to enter a new grid size (up to 100). The grid is rebuilt to fit within the same container dimensions (e.g., 960px × 960px).

- **Extra Credits (Optional Enhancements)**  
  - Random RGB color on each hover
